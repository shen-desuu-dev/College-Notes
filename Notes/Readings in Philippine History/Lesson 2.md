# Note

	- **Identify the bias** - ==biased, one-sided partisan, prejudiced==
- **Contextual Analysis**
	- **Historical Context of the Source**

	- **The Background of the Author**
		- The ==author of the primary source should be credible.==

	- **The Relevance of the Source in the Present**
		- The ==information from the source must have the relevance in the present== and ==must be logical to provide truth and objectivity==.
- **Why History is not Tsismis**
	- If a tsismis is ==verified and fact-checked then it is no longer a tsismis but a fact==.
	- A piece of gossip is gossip because you cannot confirm it. ==If it is confirmed, that is not tsismis anymore==
	- It is **an ignorant claim and and un utter disrespect** to compare a historian and scholar to a marites --**Historians gather evidence, validate the true story of the historical events and analyze implications.**
	- **History is not just a mere story,** ==it is a methodology, ask questions, investigate and compare.==
